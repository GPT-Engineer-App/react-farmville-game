# react-farmville-game

Saverville is a Farmville style game played in a web browser. The game is a react application.

When the player enters the game, they see their farm and one large farm plot where they can plant seeds. The player can buy seeds from the store and plant them in the farm plot. The player can water the plants and harvest them when they are ready. The player can sell the plants for money.

The player will be able to perform the following actions:

1. Buy Seeds 
2. Plant seeds
3. Water plants
4. Harvest plants
5. Sell plants for money

The game is played in real time, so the plants will grow even when the user is not playing. 

The user is represented by a character that can move around the map and interact with the plants.
